## Overview

Tic Tac Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply click on an empty tile in the grid to place your symbol (X or O). The game will automatically switch turns between Player X and Player O. The game ends when one player successfully gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or if all the tiles are filled without a winner (draw).

To reset the game at any time, click the "Reset" button.

## Features
